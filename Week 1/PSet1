//The task was to create a mario mountain. Basically nest some loops such that you can print a different outcome depending on the iteration in the loop

//I learned how to create and compile a C code in VSCode
//create the code by finding a directory you want to be in >>cd directoryname
//create the c file >>code filename
//compile the C code >>gcc -o filename.c filename
//run the file ./filename

//My logic is a little flawed with loops and I'm still working on it but I eventually got the result with some help.

        scanf("%d", &height);
    } while (height < 0 || height > 8);

    //Now we have the height of our shape
    //Create an antiheight so that we have multible variables to work with
    int antiheight = height;
