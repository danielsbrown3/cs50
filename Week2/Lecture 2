Last week in C used "make" short cut to compile our programs in clang 
However that will not work for most of our programs 
Command line argument
clang -o hello hello.c
(compiler) (-output) (output file name) (file)

if you run a default compiler the out is a.out

clang -o hello hello.co -lcs50
(compiler) (-operator) (file name) (list cs50 because call the library)
stdio.h is already provide with C

prepreocessing
================
# is preprocessed in C
The libraries that you include are stored in your hard drive in /usr/include 
to see whats in there /l /usr/include basically creates the functions of the library

compiling
================
conversion of C into assembly code

assembling
================
converts text file into assembly 
assembly looks like
main
  pushq
  xorl
  movl
  callq get_string

linking
=================
links all the 01010101 for the libraries and files together

decompile
=================
might not tell you what is wrong with your code as for loops and while loops may look the same

debugging
=================
add in printline everywhere
print out the iterator in your loop
debugger is built in vsCode
all the way to the left of the code click break point
then run 
# debug50 ./(code name)
will highlight where the error occurs
tells you all the variables that exist on the left
debug has GUI to assist in debugging 

rubber duck
===============
talk to someone or an imaginary duck

types
===============
bool 1 byte
int 4 bytes
long 8 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
char 1 byte
string ? bytes

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int score1= 72;
  int score2= 73;
  int score3= 33;

  printf(" Average: %i\n", (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3.0);
}
// be sure that 3 is a float since we get a float when we take the average

Arrays
=============
an array must use an int to call which element there is

ints scores[3]; //initializes an array
score[0]= 72;
score[1]= 73;
score[2]= 33;

or 

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
  scores[i]=get_int("scores: ");
}

function
=============

const int N = 3;
float average(int array[])
{
  int sum = 0; //intialize sum
  for (int i = 0; i < N, i++) //starting at i = 0 for i < N loop through then add 1 to i
  {
    sum = sum + array[i] //for each loop add sum and the corresponding i element in array
  }
  return sum / (float) N //return the sum divided by the total
}

strings
===========
in memory can think of it as char or int in an array
always has 1 extra byte \0 NUL letting the computer know the string ends


#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  string name = get_name("What's your name? ");

  int n = 0;
  while ([n] != '\0')
  {
    n++;
  }
  printf("%i\n",n);
}

string.h a library of string related functions
strlen tells you the length of a string

ctype.h a library for chars

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
  string s = get_string("Before :");
  printf("After: ");
  for (int = 0; i < strlen(s); i++)
  {
    if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
    {
      printf("%c", s[i] - 32); //converts lowercase to uppercase 
    }
    else
    {
      printf("%c",s[i]);
    }
  }
}

instead of this compelx code can use islower(s[i]) returns true or false boolean value

Command Line Arguments
======================
inserting argc (length of array) and arv (array of strings)
instead of having get_string() to prompt the user 
can 
int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
   printf("Hello, %s %s\n",argv[1],argv[2])
  //takes in two strings as input in command line when running the program and stores and returns them after Hello
}

exit status
===========
whenever a function runs it returns a secret integer

echo $? returns what the code returns
0 means the code ran correctly

cryptography
============
cipher encrpys something from plaintext to ciphertext

Section 2:
===================
int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, world");
}

||
\/
$clang -o hello hello.c 

Assembly

||
\/

binary
====================
Arrays

Storing information in an array is more efficient. 
int hours = {2,3,4,14,};

#include <string.h>

strlen(word) //gives the length of the word

Why use >>return 0; at the end of your if statement in C?

Command line arguments
int main(int argc, string arv[])
{
} 
intead of inputting nothing "void" into command line, now you can input argv
argc is just the count or length of argv
for example
./make mario
argv[0] is "make" argv[1] is "mario"
argv[1][2] would be "a"

Functions
============
int add_two_ints(int a, int b);

int main(void)
{
  printf("Give me and integer: ");
  int x = get_int();
  printf("Give me another integer: ");
  int y = get_int();

  int z = add_two_ints(x,y);

}

int add_two_ints(int a, int b)
{
  int sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}

Example writing my own function
===============================
int valid_triangle();

int valid_triangle(int length, int width, int height)
{
  int check;
  int check2;
  int check3;
  if (length > 0 || width > 0 || height > 0)
  {
    check = (length + width) > height;
    check2 = (length + height) > width;
    check3 = (width + height) > length;
    if (check + check2 + check3 == 3)
    {
      return true
    }
  else
  {
  return false
  }
}
}


Scope
==========
local variables can only be accessed within a function
global variables can be accessed anywhere in the script

passed by value: the function doesnt recieve the variable rather it recieves a copy of the variable  (local variables)


Arrays
======
hold a bunch of the same data structure in the same place

arrays start at 0 and end at length-1

bool battleship[10][10]; //creates a matrix of 10 x 10

cannot assign 1  array to anther, need to use a loop to assign each element of one array to anther array

Arrays are passed by reference, does not get a copy of an array like variables ususally are in a function

Command Line Arguments
=======================
collecting data at the comannd line

int main(int argc, string arv[])

argc stand for argument count - how much stuff the user typed

everything in argv is stored as a string "1023214" is stored as a string in argv not integer
